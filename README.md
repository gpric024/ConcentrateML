# ConcentrateML
## Status: :construction: On pause, I have started working with UOttawa connected autonomous vehicles.
## Project Derscription:
This is a personal project in which I am using machine learning to help students concentrate during their online classes. The goal is for the model to recognize when a student is distracted (i.e. goes on their phone) during class. 

### How it works:
Not all of the specifications are finialized yet. However, I hope that once completed, the student should open the program right before their class starts. Whenever the student gets distracted during their class by going on their phone, a audio sound will play as a small reminder to pay attention in class.
