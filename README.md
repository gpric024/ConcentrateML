# ConcentrateML
## Project Status: :construction: (In development, hopefully I will have a first version available in February 2022.)
## Project Derscription:
This is a personal project in which I am using object detection to help students concentrate during their online classes. The goal is for the model to recognize when a student is distracted (i.e. goes on their phone) during class. 

### How it works:
Not all of the specifications are finialized yet. However, I hope that once completed, the student should open the program right before their class starts. Whenever the student gets distracted during their class by going on their phone, a audio sound will play as a small reminder to pay attention in class.
